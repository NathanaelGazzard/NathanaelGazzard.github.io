First of all, thank you for playing! I know very few people ever will, so that makes you special! :P If it isn't self-evident (I really hope it is), the styalistic choices made for this game are meant to reference the incredible campiness and cheese of the classic Command & Conquer games. Much of my childhood was spent with Red Alert 2 and Tim Curry's glorious acting (for reference please see this clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Sq1Nr58hM - enjoy!). For real though, it's been a blast working on this project. I've been learning game development as a hobby for a number of years now but this is technically the first game I have ever properly finished. Thanks to the teaching team at Griffith university for all their support. I would also like to say a special thanks to Ivo van Dijk for allowing me to use his music for the project. I'd also like to say thanks to Wein Lau for some last minute beta testing. Anyhow, wishing you all the best, Nathanael Gazzard.
